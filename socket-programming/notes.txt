Network programming gets more interesting when you dive into socket programming
using the go primitives.

Three keywords come up most when you glance through the net package of the go
programming language's communication primitives
- Dial => this is used to establish connections for sending messages
- Conn => this represents a connection that you communicate through
- Listen => this is used to establish connections for recieving requests from other servers who are probably using dial to send messages ( thats if they use golang too. )
